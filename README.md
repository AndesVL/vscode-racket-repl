# Racket REPL

This extensions allows for Racket files to be run within Racket's REPL from Visual Studio Code's editor.

## Features

Run (or stop) the REPL using the buttons in the editor-title bar.
The REPL launches in the integrated VSCode terminal (emulating DrRacket's repl).

## Requirements

Racket needs to be installed (and added to the terminal's shell path).
Currently only works when using Windows (batch) or Linux + Bash (or a similar shell).

## ToDo
- fix mac issues
